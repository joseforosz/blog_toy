This is a thrown together example for the Reston Ruby Newbies group.  Based on the Blogger demo for Rails 3 published as a lab exercise by JumpStart Labs, this incomplete example exists solely to show the concept of a nested, restful route between a blog entry and a comment.

If this were actual production code, it would have a real gui, real tests, etc.  The only thing to take away from this example are:

1) The examples in the routes file
2) The controller's create method
3) How the nested restful route is created for the comment form at the bottom of the blog_entry's view page (the form_for values).
